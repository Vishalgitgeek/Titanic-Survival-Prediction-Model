# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Model
This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not based on their gender, age, fare, and class using a Decision Tree algorithm
## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, such as:
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- Pclass: The class of the passenger (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female).
- Age: Age of the passenger.
- Fare: The fare paid for the ticket.
- The model was trained on this dataset to predict survival based on these features.

## Results
After training and evaluation, the model showed an accuracy of 74% on the test dataset. Below is  confusion matrix
